# Homebrew-pyenv

This tap provides Homebrew formulae for various `pyenv` plugins not available in the core repository.

## Installing Homebrew-pyenv Formulae

Just `brew tap jawshooah/pyenv` and then `brew install <formula>`. You only need to tap the repository once.

Or, if you would like to install the latest development release:

```
brew install --HEAD <formula>
```

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jawshooah/homebrew-pyenv/master/<formula>.rb
```
